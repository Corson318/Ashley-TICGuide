# ``ticguide``: **quick + painless TESS observing information**

Adapted from the TESS [``tvguide``](https://github.com/tessgi/tvguide) concept, which would tell you if your target *should be* observed by TESS (i.e. in the future), this tool tells you if your target ***was*** already observed by TESS.
